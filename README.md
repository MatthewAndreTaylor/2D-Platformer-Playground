## Goals â›³

Learn about 2d physics. I wanted the character to feel bouncy to traverse complex 2d stages.

Use the WASD keys to move the player around the screen.

Implement a working level maker and play tester.

You can modify the stage while paused. Tool I developed for designing small platformer levels.
